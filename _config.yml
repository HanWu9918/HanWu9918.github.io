  Hi, my name's Han Wu (吴瀚). I'm currently an undergraduate student at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, majoring in Automation (IEEE Pilot Class) with a minor in Intellectual Property Law.  

  My academic interests lie in artificial intelligence, especially large language models (LLMs), as well as software engineering and intelligent systems. I aspire to pursue a career as a researcher or software engineer, focusing on building innovative AI systems and practical applications.  

  Beyond academics, I enjoy track & field, technology writing, and exploring new ideas in law and policy.
