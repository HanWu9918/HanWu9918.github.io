  Hi, my name's Han Wu (吴瀚). I'm currently an undergraduate student at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, majoring in Automation (IEEE Pilot Class) with a minor in Intellectual Property Law.  

  My academic interests lie in artificial intelligence, especially large language models (LLMs), as well as software engineering and intelligent systems. I aspire to pursue a career as a researcher or software engineer, focusing on building innovative AI systems and practical applications.  

  Beyond academics, I enjoy track & field, technology writing, and exploring new ideas in law and policy.

          Reduce MoA cost and latency via pre-inference routing and lightweight judging.

          - Period: May 2025 - Aug 2025
          - Status: Under review 
          - Problem & Goal: Cut inference cost/latency of layered multi-agent collaboration while keeping quality competitive.
          - Key idea: Use a lightweight scorer to shortlist high-potential agents before inference; then apply a mixture of judges for posterior correction using existing outputs; finally rank agents by performance–cost–latency trade-off.
          - My contribution: Implemented core routing and evaluation pipeline, trained the scorer, built experiment/ablation runs, and managed experiment artifacts and metrics.
